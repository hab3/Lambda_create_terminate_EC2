Project Description:

Create and configure an AWS Lambda function using Python, interact with AWS services through the Boto3 library, and automate the process of launching an EC2 instance.

Scenario:

Apex Limited is seeking an automated solution to manage EC2 instances effectively in their AWS environment. The goal is to reduce costs, improve resource utilization, and ensure that instances are terminated when no longer needed. This project outlines the use case for automating EC2 instance management.



Prerequisites:

AWS account with necessary permissions.

Basic knowledge of AWS services.

Basic knowledge of Python.



Hints
Step 1: Setup IAM and Architecture

- Set up IAM roles with EC2 and Lambda permissions.

- Sketch a basic architecture diagram.

- Capture a screenshot of the IAM roles setup and architecture diagram.

Step 2: Create Lambda Function

- Develop a Lambda function to create EC2 instances.

- Define instance specifications as environment variables.

Step 3: Cleanup Lambda Function

- Write a Lambda function to terminate unnecessary EC2 instances.

- Specify criteria for instance termination.

Step 4: Configure Triggers

- Configure CloudWatch Events to trigger Lambda functions.

- Set event sources for creation and cleanup triggers.

- Capture a screenshot of the trigger configuration.

Step 5: Test and Validate

- Test both Lambda functions with sample events.

- Verify correct instance creation and termination.

- Capture screenshots of successful test results.

Step 6: Document and Train

- Create clear documentation for deploying and using the automation.

- Provide training on the solution to users or students.

- Commit all code, architecture diagram, and IAM policy to GitHub.

- Submit the GitHub repository link along with screenshots, architecture diagram, and IAM policy as part of your submission.
